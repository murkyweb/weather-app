# weather-app

A weather app which shows the current weather for the specified location.
Made with HTML, CSS, JS and bundled with Webpack.
The app is using the OpenWeather API.

By working on this project I learned about asynchronous code using the async and await keywords and about API calls.

This project was created for the [Weather App assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) as part of The Odin Project.
